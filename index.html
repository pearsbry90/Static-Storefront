            <h2>Quirkless</h2>
            <p>Among the 20% here lies the No Quirks. Fear not, these individuals still have hearts of warriors, minds of geniuses, and built this world from the ground up, with their bare hands. Despite not being "superhumans", they still have the super abilities to inspire and change lives.</p>

            <h2>Quirk Enjoyers</h2>
            <p>I get it, why does one have to grow up to be what mommy and daddy wants them to be. Why does one have to decide how they have to live their life with their Quirk? Quit stressing if your Quirk is "quality worth" to change the world, or that it's not "cool enough" for an Academy. You Matter, and that's the point. Enjoy the blessing bestowed on you. Love Yo'self and Yo' Quirk. Just make sure you still get it licensed to use in public.</p>

            <h2>Students</h2>
            <p>Competition will never leave your site, however homework will. What school are you attending? What agency are you looking forward to? It's amazing seeing youths working as hard as Hero's, putting time in and out to be better than the Old G's. Who are you going to surpass? Connect with other students, you never who will be your Boss, your employer, even your partner. Help out others, as you're helping yourself, and keep grinding to the Top.</p>

            <h2>Hero's</h2>
            <p>Thank you for your service. Without you, we would be DOOMED. Without teamwork, you probably wouldn't have saved the day. With all the "Thank You's" and camera's in your face, here, you can relax. No calls, no news, no outside work source, just peace with other Hero's. Here's a platform to let loose and be You, outside of your Heroic Duties. </p>

            <h2>Villians</h2>
            <p>I cannot discriminate, so yes, you get a page. Just know I am watching (from a far). Obey My Rules, please. My mom said, "If you cannot say anything nice, don't say anything at all;" but you're still the Bad Guys. Have a great day. </p>
